    <h1>Segway in USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very
      own Segway!<p>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I
      finally got everything packed and ready to go.
      Because I'm on a segway, I wasn't able to bring
      a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li>ipod</li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>protein bar</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
      <q><em>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one
        step segway.</em></q>
    </p>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side
      of the road today:</p>
    <blockquote><strong>Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see.<br>
      May get you,<br>
      A glimpse<br>
      Of eternity.<br></strong>
      <dl>
        <em><dt>Burma Shave Signs</dt>
        <dd>Road signs common in the US in the 1920s
        and 1930s advertising shaving products.</dd></em>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I definitely won't pass any car.</p>

      <li>Magic City, ID</li>
